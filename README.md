# A set of uBlock Origin filters for getting rid of all the junk in [https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com)

## Instructions

1. Install the [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm](uBlock Origin) extension.

(It's an advertising blocker which is open source. I trust it not to do anything bad given the community of people studying the code.)

2. Once installed, click on uBlock Origin's icon (which may be found in the list of icons to the right of the URL bar in Chrome).

3. This will bring up a menu. Click on the "Open the dashboard" icon rightmost under the big 0/1.

4. Click on the tab "3rd party filters" and scroll all the way to the bottom to the text box under "One URL per line..."

5. Paste the following URL into the text box at the bottom: 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimjamfinance/yahoo_finance_ublock_origin_filters/master/yahoo_finance.txt

6. Click on the "Apply changes" button in the upper right.

7. Close the dashboard tab

8. Reload [https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com)

## Suggestions welcome

I did this as a quick hack for myself after the 2017-2018 Google Finance fiasco... I'd welcome comments and suggestions for improvements.
